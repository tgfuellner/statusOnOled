# ssd1306: Introduction

The official SSD1306 OLED display driver supports a single 8x8 pixel monospaced
font. Users of the 128x64 displays in particular may wish to use larger fonts.
This provides a means of extending the official driver to support this. Suitable
font files may be created from standard ``ttf`` or ``otf`` files using the utility
presented [here](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py.git).



## Release notes

V0.21 21st March 2017 The ``Writer`` class now uses the framebuf blit method.
This works for monochrome devices using 1-bit colour mapping. Example code is
provided for rendering to colour devices: the framebuf class does not yet offer
an effective way to handle colour mapping when blitting between buffers with
differing colour maps.

Note that framebuf scrolling does not clear the exposed region of the screen.
This is by design but see issue #2692.

# Files

1. ssd1306_test.py A simple test program.
2. ssd1306.py A snapshot of the current official driver.
3. writer.py A generic Writer class. Keeps track of the text insertion point
over multiple fonts, handles newline and vertical scrolling if required.

In addition several font files are provided as samples.

# Getting started

The file ``ssd1306_test.py`` may need editing to match your hardware notably
the values of WIDTH and HEIGHT which are set to 128x64 (w*h) pixels. Wiring
details are included in code comments but may be changed if required as soft
I2C and SPI interfaces are specified.

Its principal testing was performed on Pyboards but I'd expect it to be
portable to any device supporting the official driver and the `machine` module.

Copy files 1-3 and ``freesans20.py`` to the target and issue

```python
import ssd1306_test
ssd1306_test.test() # If it uses an I2C connection
ssd1306_test.test(True) # If it uses SPI
```

# Principle of Operation

Font files are converted to Python modules for ease of use and also (optionally)
to enable the modules to be frozen as bytecode to reduce RAM requirements.

The user program should import all fonts which are to be used and declare a
``Writer`` instance for each one. Rendering text at the current insertion point
is then simply a matter of issuing the appropriate writer's ``printstring``
method. After issuing all such calls required by your application the display
should be updated by issuing

```python
ssd.show()
```

# The Writer class

The principal interaction with the driver is via this class. One instance should
be created for each font in use. Its function is to keep track of the text
insertion point over successive uses with multiple fonts and to handle newline
characters and vertical scrolling. Its behaviour when text overruns the end of
a line or the bottom of the screen may be controlled using its ``set_clip``
method.

## Methods

1. ``Constructor`` This takes the ``ssd`` display instance and the font module
as mandatory args.
2. ``printstring`` Takes a text string as argument and renders it at the current
insertion point. Respects newline characters.

## Class methods

1. ``set_textpos`` Mandatory integer args ``row``, ``col`` defined in pixels
relative to the top left hand corner of the display. Sets the current text
insertion point. The coordinates of a glyph refer to its top left corner. The
initial default is (0,0) with text being rendered at the top left of the display.
2. ``set_clip`` Mandatory boolean args ``row_clip``, ``col_clip``. These define
behaviour when text overruns the physical width or height of the display. By
default text overrunning the display width will continue on the next row. Setting
``col_clip`` overrides this such that overrunning text is lost. Similarly, by
default text overrunning the bottom of the display will cause text above to
scroll up to accommodate it. Setting ``row_clip`` will override this behaviour
causing text to be clipped.

# Use of font_to_py.py

To convert font files to Python for use with this driver the default (vertical)
mapping and bit order should be used. The only optional argument which may be
needed is ``-f`` if fixed-width rendering is desired.
